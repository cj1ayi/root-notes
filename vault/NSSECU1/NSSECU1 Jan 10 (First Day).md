## Introduction to Information Security

History of InfoSec

- Larry Roberts invented ARPANET - predecessor to the internet
    - ARPANET Capabilities

What’s Security?
- very broad

Domains:
- physical security
- personal security
- operations security
- communications security
- network security
- information security


What is C.I.A Triad (Bread and Butter of InfoSec)
- YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS IN THE CYBERSEC field
- It’s a standard based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

### CIA Triad

**Confidentiality**
- The org’s effort to keep the data private or secret. 
- “If it’s not yours, do not access it. (Unless you are authorized)”

- Examples:
    - Password
    - Address
    - Name
    - Credit Cards
    - Salary
  
**Integrity**
- quality of something being whole or complete
- ensures that the data has not been tampered
- data can be trusted
- Examples:
    - Encryption
    - Digital Signatures
    - Promising that you will stay, yet you leave

  
**Availability**
- your most used applications are running
- like if the Banks were down it affects availability
- ensures authorized users have timely, reliable access to resources when they are needed
- Examples
    - Applications
    - ANIMOSYS (BAD AVAILABILITY)

## Common Threats in Cybersecurity
### 1. Malware
they can...
- gather information
	- ex: keystrokes
- viruses and worms
	- cannot read your files/ruin your day
- participate in a group
	- controlled over the internet
- show you advertising
	- big money (pop-ups)

**How do you get Malware??**
your pc ran a program
- clicking email malicious links
- web page pop up
- worm download

Phishing
- a cybercrime which targets us 
- we are being contacted by someone posing as something legit
- lures ppl into providing sensitive info\

## 2. Social Engineering
- MANIPULATION

### 3. APT -- Advance Persistent Threats
- individuals or groups backed by a gov or nation state
- they engage in cyber espionage, sabotage or other activites

## Common Vulnerabilities
Defining Terms
- Cybersecurity risk
	- probability of exposure or loss resulting from a cyber attack or data breach
- Risks can be from cyberattack from other situations that affect our environment, such as fire, violent crime, or natural disasters.

Why do we need this?
Vulnerability
- a **gap** or weakness in an org's protections f its valuable assets
- a **threat** is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability
- **an asset** is something in need of protection

### Vulnerability, Threat and Asset Scenario
A vulneratility is an inherent weakness of flaw in a system or component, which if triggered 

## Common Vulnerabilities in Cybersecurity
### Passwords
- people use weak passwords
- they re-use them

### Unpatched Systems


### Misconfigurations
- allows unauthorized access
### Human (Social Engineering)

## Importance of Information Security Defense
### Where do I start?
- look for a standard framework, then follow the best practice!
	- what is a framework?
		- NIST / ISO
	- Why? They offer guidelines and ensure a comprehensive repeatable approach
Frameworks to Know
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001

### Awareness as Defense
Key Components of Awareness Programs
- Thread Recognition: Identifying common attacks (e.g., phishing, social engineering).
- Best Practices: Encouraging strong passwords, secure device use and cautious online behaviour.
- Incident Reporting: Training users to report suspicious activity promptly 

Impact of Awareness
- Reduces human error
- Enhances overall organizational security posture
- Builds a culture of vigilance and shared responsibility 

### *Why it matters?*
- prevents data breaches and financial losses
- protects privacy and org reputation
- enables rapid detection
- builds resilience against cyber threats
